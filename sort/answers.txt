sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: it is the fastest method when sorting a large database (random50000.txt) it divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.
It is well-suited for large datasets and generally outperforms Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.
