// Operators refer to the mathematical operations that are supported by your compiler.
// In C, these mathematical operators include:

// + for addition
// - for subtraction
// * for multiplication
// / for division
// % for remainder
// Types refer to the possible data that can be stored within a variable.
// For example, a char is designed to accommodate a single character like a or 2.
// Types are very important because each type has specific limits.
// For example, because of the limits in memory, the highest value of an int can be 4294967296.
// Types with which you might interact during this course include:

// bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false
// char, a single character like a or 2
// double, a floating-point value with more digits than a float
// float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
// int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
// long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int
// string, a string of characters
