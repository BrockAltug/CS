sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It is the faster method when sorting a large database (random50000.txt) it divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.
It is well-suited for large datasets and generally outperforms Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It performs a smaller number of swaps compared to bubble sort; therefore, even though both sorting methods are of O(N2), selection sort performs faster and more efficiently,
