//Linux and the Command Line
//Linux is an operating system that is accessible via the command line in the terminal window in VS Code.
//Some common command-line arguments we may use include:
//cd - for changing our current directory (folder)
//cp - for copying files and directories
//ls - for listing files in a directory
//mkdir - for making a directory
//mv - for moving (renaming) files and directories
//rm - for removing (deleting) files
//rmdir - for removing (deleting) directories
//The most commonly used is ls which will list all the files in the current directory or directory.
//Go ahead and type ls into the terminal window and hit enter. You’ll see all the files in the current folder.
//Another useful command is mv, where you can move a file from one file to another. For example,
//you could use this command to rename Hello.c (notice the uppercase H) to hello.c by typing mv Hello.c hello.c.
//You can also create folders. You can type mkdir pset1 to create a directory called pset1.
//You can then use cd pset1 to change your current directory to pset1.

// Operators and Types
// Operators refer to the mathematical operations that are supported by your compiler.
// In C, these mathematical operators include:

// + for addition
// - for subtraction
// * for multiplication
// / for division
// % for remainder
// Types refer to the possible data that can be stored within a variable.
// For example, a char is designed to accommodate a single character like a or 2.
// Types are very important because each type has specific limits.
// For example, because of the limits in memory, the highest value of an int can be 4294967296.
// Types with which you might interact during this course include:

// bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false
// char, a single character like a or 2
// double, a floating-point value with more digits than a float
// float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
// int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
// long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int
// string, a string of characters
